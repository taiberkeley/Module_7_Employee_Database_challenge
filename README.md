# Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  Through the analysis above, we have concluded that 72,458 employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 are eligible to retire. That means that the company will have to hire more than 50,000 new employees if they want to replace all that wprk force.
  
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  Unfortunately there are not enough qualified retirement-ready employees in the departments since only 32% are Engineers (501) and more than 20,000 Engineers and Senior Engineers are retiring.
